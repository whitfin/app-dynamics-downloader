# AppDynamics Downloader (appddl)

[![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/appddl.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/appddl) [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/whitfin/appddl/CI)](https://github.com/whitfin/appddl/actions)

Extremely small CLI tool used to download archives from AppDynamics.

This tool is meant to assist in automation rather than provide utility for a one-time download. You likely
won't find it useful in manual use. It includes everything you need to customize your installation, and is
extremely useful for automated builds (as downloads require auth).

## Installation

You can install `appddl` from either this repository, or from Crates (once it's published):

```shell
# install from Cargo
$ cargo install appddl

# install the latest from GitHub
$ cargo install --git https://github.com/whitfin/appddl.git
```

## Usage

This image is designed to be executed as a single command, to download a file to your host:

```bash
$ appddl \
    # provide your login credentials
    --username 'my-username' \
    --password 'my-password' \

    # customise the endpoints used on AppDynamics, for future proofing URL changes
    --auth-endpoint 'https://identity.msrv.saas.appdynamics.com/v2.0/oauth/token' \
    --files-endpoint 'https://download.appdynamics.com/download/downloadfilelatest/' \

    # the default output name is the located file name
    --output 'golang-sdk-x64-linux-4.3.0.6.tar.gz' \

    # the file name or identifier you want to download
    'golang-sdk-x64-linux-4.3.0.6.tar.gz'
```

The following is the automated documentation generated by the tool:
